## How to get here üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The conference will take place at the **University of Pisa** in the **Polo Fibonacci**. Pisa is a small town and you can easily walk around or rely on public transportation if you're coming from far away.

The address of the venue is: **Largo Bruno Pontecorvo, 3, 56127 Pisa PI**

## By train üöÑ
Pisa's railway station (Pisa Centrale) is directly connected with Turin, Rome, Genova and Milan. There are frequent connections with the Florence main station (Firenze Santa Maria Novella) that you can reach with an high-speed train (Freccia Rossa). 

[The train schedule is available at the site of Trenitalia.](http://www.trenitalia.com)

Recall that in Italy, before getting on the train, you must stamp your ticket by using those small yellow machines available within the station. 
To reach the venue, you can take the city bus number 4 and get off at the bus stop in via Buonarroti (stop called Buonarroti 1).

As an alternative, the Department is at walking distance from the railway station (approximately 20-30 minutes).

Pisa is near the intersection of two highways: A12 north-south (Genova - Rosignano) and A11 east-west (Pisa - Florence). 

Please note that Pisa is a small town with several pedestrian areas (with access control cameras). Parking is a bit of a problem and most parking areas are with pay-meters.
