Hi everyone 👋

That's it! Our Call for Paper is now closed ⛔️. 

We have to say that're we're more than amazed by what we saw so far! We'd love to thank everyone who spent time and passion to craft a proposals for our DevFest Pisa 2020.

At DevFest Pisa 0.1 we received **43** proposals.
At DevFest Pisa 2019 we received **95** proposals.
This year we received... **184** proposals 😱!!!

In total **118 speakers** submitted to our CFP with an average of **1.56** sessions per speaker.

We're going to have a really hard time choosing between all of them. We already apologize upfront but we will have to reject someone 😰 given that the competition is really high.

Stay tuned as we're already working on the the DevFest Pisa **Agenda**. As last years, we will announce speakers in different rounds, and we're going to reveal some really soon!

Today we're happy to share some pretty interesting **statistics** from our Call for Paper.

In this graph you can see the trend of the CFP submission:

Again, _procrastination_ is driving our CFP 😂 The last proposal was sent on Monday the TODO at **23.40**.

Most of the proposals comes from Italy, but we're happy to share that we received some proposals from all around the globe! 🌎 Here you can find a map of the countries where the proposals came from:

Also this year **Web** is confirmed as the #1 topic in the proposals with 46 proposals (with Android just after at 44):

We also received quite a few proposals on the Cloud/Flutter side. A significant amount of **Diversity and Inclusion** following the success of our soft track last year.

Here's an heatmap of all the words in all the submitted abstracts:
