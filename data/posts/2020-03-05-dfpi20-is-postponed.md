Hi all,

In light of the current Coronavirus [COVID-19] situation in Italy, and in accordance with health guidance from the WHO and the Italian Government, we sadly have to **postpone DevFest Pisa 2020 to a later date**. 

Our first priority is the safety of our community, attendees, speakers and partners. Unfortunately, the current situation doesn't allow us to deliver an event that is safe and enjoyable for everyone.

We are not currently able to provide a new date at this point in time, but we hope to find a new suitable weekend **this fall**.

This was a really complicated decision for us, as the whole event is organized on a voluntary basis. We already spent a lot of time connecting with venue, sponsors, speakers and collaborators and we're extremely committed to provide a high quality event. This time we decide that your safety comes first. We hope you all understand our decision.

Any questions? Please email us at [pisagdg@gmail.com](mailto:pisagdg+devfest@gmail.com) or reach out on our social channels.

Looking forward to see you soon,

DevFest Pisa Orga team.
