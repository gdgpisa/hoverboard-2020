Hi everyone,

Our Call for Paper is closed. Now our organizer team work really hard to define the DevFest Pisa **Agenda!** We're happy to share that we're nearly done, and we'll be announcing the first speakers really soon.

If you're a speaker, please check your inbox as you might already received a feedback. If not, you'll get a feedback in the upcoming days.

Today we're happy to share some pretty interesting **statistics** from our Call for Paper.

First, we'd love to thank everyone who applied for spending time and preparing high-quality abstracts for our CFP. This year we received **184** proposals ðŸ˜± (compared to 43 from DevFest Pisa 2018 and to 95 from DevFest Pisa 2019). Choosing which talks to accept was really a challenge given the general quality of them.

In this graph you can see the trend of the CFP submission: 






You can clearly see how the procrastinators waited until the last minute before submitting their proposals. ðŸ˜‚

Most of the proposals comes from Italy, but we're happy to share that we received some proposals from all around the globe! ðŸŒŽ Here you can find a map of the countries where the proposals came from:






Talking about the content, this year **Web** is confirmed as the #1 topic in the proposals unlike in previous years:




We also received quite a few proposals on the Cloud side. A significant amount of Flutter proposals was also worth noting and several interesting talks on **Diversity and Inclusion**.

We're so excited for the upcoming DevFest! ðŸ’ª Can't wait to enjoy this amazing event with all of you. Make sure to grab your ticket:
