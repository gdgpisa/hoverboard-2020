As of today, we are happy to officially open our [call for talk submissions](http://bit.ly/dfpi20-c4p). If you are passionate about what you do and you have a story to tell to the tech audience in Italy, you knocked on the right door!

## Session Formats

For this year we decided to accept different 3 types of submissions:

* **Tech Talks** - A space to deliver high-level technical content, tell us about your project or share your experience with the DevFest attendees.

* **Workshops** - A space to provide hands-on or deep-dive on specific technologies. Attendees will be restricted to a maximum number to provide a more comfortable workshop environment.

* **Soft Talk** - A space where you can talk about soft skills, diversity & inclusion, inspiration and whatever is _non-techy_ but you you want to share at our DevFest.

## Session Duration

As last year, we want to offer speakers the opportunity to decide how long they want to perform on stage. For this reason we are offering 4 duration choices:

* **40 minutes** - The classical session size. It allows you to deliver in depth session about your topic and engage with the audience at a deeper level.

* **20 minutes** - The shorter session size. It allows you to deliver content is a _lighter_ way without overloading the audience with so much content. 

* **10 minutes** - Suitable for **lightning talk**. This is the best choice if you're afraid of public speaking but you still want to be on stage to tell us your story.

* **1+ hour** - Suitable for Workshops only.
