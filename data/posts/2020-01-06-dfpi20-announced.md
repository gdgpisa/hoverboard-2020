Are you ready for 2020? Are you for the new decade?

**We do!** And we decided to start it **doubling down** on our main event, the DevFest Pisa!

We're more than excited to announce that in 2020, DevFest Pisa will take place on **two days**!!! ❤️❤️

DevFest Pisa 2020 will take place on **Saturday 18th April** and **Sunday 19th April**. As always, we're going to wait for you in the _Aula Magna_ of Polo Fibonacci! 

The community asked really strongly to have **more content** and more opportunities to meat and engage with speakers and attendees. We strongly believe that having a two days event will allow everyone to enjoy an amazing DevFest and great connections with the community.

DevFest Pisa 2019 was a huge success! We had **nearly 500 participants** and **39 speakers** in a single day (have you checked the [video recap from last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5d-EOTWOOU)?. The schedule was really packed, with a lot of sessions and workshops in parallel. 

This year, we want DevFest to be a place to learn, relax and **enjoy the vibe** of the community.

As always, we're fully committed on delivering a **totally free event**. We enjoy to say that DevFest is organized **by the community, for the community**. We want to allow to everyone to be part of the DevFest Pisa organization, either as a speaker, as a volunteer or as a organizer. Stay tuned as details for participating to the DevFest will be coming soon.

But today you can already reserve your place taking your **free ticket**. The DevFest is happening in several months, but make sure you're not missing your seat:
