 We know that you could have some questions so we prepared for you a list of **FAQs** that may can help you üí™

 Anyway we are alway open to solve any other doubt you could have, feel free to [contact us](mailto:pisagdg+devfest@gmail.com) in that case.

### How do I get there?

You can easily reach **Polo Fibonacci** with public transportation or just by walking. Please check the [location page](/location) where you can find further details.

### Where is "Aula N"?

Please note that this year DevFest Pisa will be in **two near buildings**. Please checkout the [map page](/map) to better understand where every room is located.

### Do I need a ticket to join DevFest Pisa?

Yes, participation to the DevFest is **free**, but registration is **mandatory**. Being in the waiting list is not sufficient to participate to the conference.

### I can't attend the DevFest, what should I do?

If you **can't attend** we kindly ask you to **cancel your order** via Eventbrite, or either send us an email (we can do it for you). The event is currently Sold-out and we have a lot of people in the waiting list. You will free-up a spot for someone else :)

### Do I need to print my tickets?

No, you can use the [Eventbrite app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eventbrite.attendee) to show us the ticket. Showing the ticket email with the QR code is also enough. Please make sure to have your ticket ready to do not slow down the check-in process.

### Should I come even if I'm still on the waiting list?

You can come even if you're in the waiting list, but we can't assure you will get a spot :( We will release tickets of people that don't show up during day so you may have a chance to get in, but this is out of our control, and we can't tell you in advance if you'll get a place.

### Can I give my ticket to someone else?

Yes, but you need to tell us about this, and we will take care of voiding your tickets and emitting a new one to your friend/relative.

### Can I leave the conference and come back later?

Yes, you can always leave the conference and come back whenever you want. To enter the venue you anyway always need your **badge** (you will get it at the entrance).

### I have the workshop ticket but I don't have the DevFest ticket? Can I participate to the workshop only?

No, as written in the workshop description, you need a DevFest ticket to join all the sessions (either talks or workshop).

### I registered on meetup.com. Is that valid as a ticket?

No, the only valid tickets for eventbrite are the one [available on Eventbrite](http://bit.ly/dfpi19-tickets).

### What should I carry on to the conference?

**Your ticket**. That's the only necessary thing you shouldn't forget. If you're attending one of our Workshops, the speakers will let you know if you need to carry on your laptop or not. 

### Will I get food/lunch at the DevFest?

Yes, we are offering a **small lunch** (beware just little food and refreshments, not a full lunch) and two coffee breaks. You can find a lot of nice restaurants in [via San Lorenzo](https://goo.gl/maps/Ck5a5kBA1EF2), just a few minutes walk from the venue.

### Are you giving away any gadgets/awards?

Yes, we have some swags for all the participants + some giveaways to give as a raffle üéÅ. All the details at the opening ceremony.

### Are the sessions recorded?

No, we are not recording/live-streaming the sessions.
